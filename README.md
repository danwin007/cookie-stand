# cookie-stand
repo for salmon cookies lab project for code 201

Note for Grader:
I went through several iterations of the .js script. Ended up using app02sandbox.js even though I intended for it to be a test environment. I made so many changes to it that it ended up being the primary .js file. 

I also used this project to make .html and .js files to follow along in class. So there are some superfluous files living in this repo.
